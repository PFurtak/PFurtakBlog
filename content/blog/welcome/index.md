&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good thing about being a web developer, is that there is no shortage of awesome tools to get the job done. This is a gift and a curse. On one hand, this satisfies my need to always be striving to better my craft; on the other hand it is pretty easy to get overwhelmed and feel like you need to learn everything. That feeling of being overwhelmed can often lead to rushed study sessions and only surface level understanding. My goal with this blog is to provide high level overviews of the topics I am currently digging into.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a learning method called the Feynman technique. Richard Feynman was a Nobel Prize winning physicist renowned for his ability to break down and explain complex topics. This is a very important skill to have in software engineering, and one I am looking to grow. Not only does the act of explaining help cement your knowledge, but it is also extremely helpful for other people new the topic.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next few months, I'll be digging into some of the more advanced and latest technologies of web development. You can look forward to seeing articles on:

- Optimizations
- GraphQL
- React
- Testing
- Redis
- Docker

**And more...**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am excited to get started! The goal is to write one or two articles per week as I progress through projects on each topic. If you have any questions, feel free to reach me by the contact links listed on this site. I look forward to hearing from you!

**Now... Let's get to work.**
